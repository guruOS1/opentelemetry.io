For languages not covered in the Lambda auto-instrumentation document, the community does not have a standalone instrumentation layer.

Users will need to follow the generic instrumentation guidance for their chosen language and add the Collector Lambda layer to submit their data.

### Instrument the Lambda with OTel

Review the [language instrumentation guidance](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/) on how to manually instrument your application.
